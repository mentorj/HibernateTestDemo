# Hibernate testing 

## Introduction
This repository contains stuff to improve Hibernate testing....
Warining: not yet finished but elements are in place, need some time to finish the puzzle

## Basic ideas
Use this code as a starting point, import your entities to be testing, create some test equivalent to the one provided
and check results....
Beware while choosing business key for equals
Warning while being consistent between equials & hashcode (cf Product.java)

Test cases may use:
- special slf4j and log4j features to check traces generated and grep patterns (and count them)
- Hibernate statistics (to count queries...)
